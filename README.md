# RateLimitReport

This script was extended from Sam Jackson's ServerReport [https://github.com/sjacks26/ServerReport]

This script is used to monitor a central limits collection generated by STACK.  
  
### Email notifications
RateLimitReport also sends a daily email update about the rate limits it monitors.   

### Installation and setup

To run RateLimitReport:  
1) Clone the code to your server using `git clone https://github.com/bitslabsyr/RateLimitReport.git`. You should run this command from a directory that your user has write permissions in; otherwise, you can run RateLimitReport as sudo.    
2) Rename `config_template.py` to `config.py`.
3) Modify the parameters in config.py to match your preferences.  
   * Specify the email accounts for recipients and for the account used to send emails.
   * Specify server, username and password for MongoDB
   * Specify DB and collection names of the central limits collection.
4) You can use crontab to run RateLimitReport daily. For example, to run the script at 1am;
   * crontab -e 
   * 0 1 * * * python /path/to/your/script/main.py
